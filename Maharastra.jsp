        <p>
The Gateway of India symbolizes the intersection of colonial history and national identity. Initially built to honor British imperial power, it blended diverse architectural styles to assert colonial authority. After India’s independence, the Gateway transformed into a symbol of freedom and national pride, marking the end of British rule. Today, it serves as a monument of collective memory, reflecting India’s journey from colonial subjugation to independence and acting as a space for cultural and historical reflection.</p>

        <p>Visiting these caves was a deeply spiritual experience. The calmness and beauty of the surroundings, combined with the fascinating stories told through the artwork, make it a place of reflection and awe.</p>
        <p> Neena :</p>
        <p>Both Ajanta and Ellora attract a lot of tourists, so they can get quite crowded, especially during peak season. It takes away a bit from the peaceful atmosphere.</p>
