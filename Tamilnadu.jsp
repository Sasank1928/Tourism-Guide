        <p>Ankitha :</p>
        <p>The Meenakshi Temple is absolutely breathtaking. The intricate carvings and towering gopurams left me in awe. It’s a perfect blend of spirituality and art. Definitely a must-visit.</p>
        <p>Indhu :</p>
        <p> The temple is not just a place of worship, but also a living example of Tamil architecture and culture. The atmosphere is so serene, and the beauty of the sculptures is unmatched</p>
        <p>Himaja :</p>
        <p>The temple has strict dress codes, and the security checks can be time-consuming. It’s worth it, but it’s something to keep in mind before visiting</p>

        <P>Sita :</P>
        <p>I love starting my day at Marina Beach. It’s the perfect place for a morning jog with the sound of the waves and a cool breeze. The view is amazing, and it’s always lively!</p>
       
        <p>Balu :</p>
        <p>There aren’t many proper facilities around the beach, like restrooms or seating. It’s more of a place to walk around and enjoy the view, but not ideal for long stays</p>
